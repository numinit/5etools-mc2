Beneath your feet, there are countless labyrinthine tunnels and cave systems, perhaps even the Underdark. Whether you're traveling along your favorite D&D world's surface or in the caverns below, we have a good idea of how to run a game in that environment.",
												"Now what we if we look up? Sure, there may be a cloud city, but I mean what if we look way up? What if we look up at a star and wonder what's up there? How do we go there? You might try flying, but you don't make it far before the spell fails and exhaustion takes over. Perhaps an airship? How does your airship fly when the air of the upper atmosphere begins to thin?  Is this some insuperable barrier to our exploration of fantasy worlds?",
												"{@b Absolutely not.}",
												"Wildjammer is a setting neutral rule-set inspired by the D&D campaign setting Spelljammer, created by Jeff Grubb and published by TSR, Inc. in 1989 as the flagship setting for D&D 2nd edition. Spelljammer gave us the means to bring our adventures up into space without losing any of the essential fantasy of D&D. It envisioned a universe structured in such a way that all D&D settings could be navigable without the rules or unique character of one setting hampering another.  Your character from Faerun (Forgotten Realms) could travel into space and find Oerth (Greyhawk) or Krynn (Dragonlance), or any other setting the DM decides to add. The goal of this Wildjammer is much the same: to offer a rule-set that can be used in a D&D 5th edition game to unite different settings and do so in a way that doesn't hamper the essential fantasy flavor of D&D.",

We envision a universe with at least the veneer of being scientific, with the impossible explained by techno-babble. There isn't much out there that takes us into space and doesn't also add this guise of science to the universe.",
														"Wildjammer isn't science-fiction or science-fantasy, it's space fantasy. The universe isn't inherently scientific, it is inherently fantastical. You don't need every planet to be more or less spherical why not have a planet in the shape of a donut? Why not have planets that have a hollow earth inside of them? Why not have stars that are conscious and intelligent? This is fantasy after all! The limit is your imagination.",
														"As you read through this supplement, you'll hear some really wild ideas that have no place in a scientific universe. I'd like to challenge you to extend your disbelief while going through this supplement, the same way we extend our disbelief when a monk runs 75 feet up a wall in a single turn of combat. Why can a sailing ship fly in space? Magic. Why do people not get sucked into the vacuum of space? It's a fantasy. Embrace it and enjoy the freedom of fantasy in space!"

														"Much like Spelljammer, Wildjammer draws a great deal of influence from the Age of Sail and the Golden Age of Piracy. Rather than thinking of Wildjammer as fantasy Star Trek, think of it more like Pirates of the Caribbean, just in space. Think Treasure Planet, sailing out into the unknown to find the space equivalent of buried treasure in the sea of night. You're sailors, except instead of sailing the ocean blue and battling sea monsters, pirates, and finding islands with buried treasure, you're sailing through space, fighting off space monsters , pirates, and finding asteroids with buried treasure."

														"If you've looked around the internet for a bit, you've probably noticed that there are quite a few projects like this one that seek to bring the wonder of Spelljammer to D&D 5e. You might be wondering why I've made this when there are already so many others out there.",
														"Simply put, while I was looking around at different products for doing D&D in space, I came across the Dark Matter campaign setting by Mage Hand Press.  This book is an excellent science-fantasy space opera setting and rule book, perfect for those looking for a setting where Spelljammer meets Mass Effect. I highly suggest checking it out! While I was reading through it, I found that the book had a wonderfully intuitive ship combat system. I decided that I wanted to adapt that system for the space fantasy of Spelljammer. Thus was born Wildjammer: More Adventures in Space!",
														"What makes the ship combat system stand out to me is how closely it mirrors ground combat. There are definitely some differences, but as a general rule of thumb, things in ship combat happen similar to how they happen in ground combat. When you fire a ballista, you're not using the ballista's attack bonus, you use your own. When a ship makes a saving throw, it is the Helmsman who makes the save, not the ship itself. Running a ship in this system treats the ship as a tool that you use and get better with as you level up, not as a stat block you use for this side game of D&D."

If you're going to be playing ina Wildjammer game, I highly recommend reading this chapter in particular.",

										"Wildjammer isn't a projection into the future. It's a love letter to the Age of Sail.  This was an era from roughly the late-1500s to the mid-1800s that was dominated by naval warfare, gunpowder weaponry, piracy, naval trading companies, and privateers. This age of exploration saw massive ships with numerous masts and sails traveling across the world to far off lands. Wildjammer seeks to capture the same feeling, but in space.",

We could start at the highest level and then zoom in, or start zoomed in and slowly extend our field of view out across the universe. In this chapter, we'll be doing the latter.

												"Lets say you're living on Toril, the planet of Forgotten Realms. One night, you leave the walls of Waterdeep and look up to the stars. You'd already know a few things about space. You'd know of the sun that warms and lights the day. You'd be aware of Selune, the moon of Toril with its glittering asteroids called Selune's Tears. You'd also be aware of those glittering lights in the night's sky that people call stars.",
												"What you might not know is that there are other planets out there, just like the one you're standing on.  These planets could be made of earth like the one you're probably on, or they could be made of water, lava, fire, air, flesh, plants, or anything. They could be spherical planets, or they could be in the shape of a torus, or a snowflake, or a cluster of floating chunks of earth. There are also asteroids, some which even have cities on them, nebulae, sargasso clouds, and all sorts of interesting things to find. These are celestial bodies, the objects and places that reside within the sea of night up above you.",
												"Celestial bodies are not required to obey the normal laws of physics. They can be made of anything and they can rotate and revolve in any direction. You can have a flat ribbon of water flowing in and between asteroids in an asteroid belt that ships sail on between floating asteroids. You can have a planet that is hollow and people live on the inside surface. Put a sun in there if you want! You can have square worlds, triangular worlds, disc worlds, turtle worlds, whatever! You are not bound by physics, as these were crafted by gods or magic. The only limit is your imagination!",

Maybe you want to see the moon up close, or travel out to a star, or find another planet and see who lives there. If you were to find a way to travel up and away from your planet, you'd eventually hit a threshold, a point where air and gravity simply stop. This is the boundary between your planet and what is called {@b wildspace}.",
												"Wildspace is essentially outer space, the empty void between celestial bodies that is often called the sea of night. It is suffused with a nearly imperceptible but ever present magical energy known as {@b aether}.",
												"Comparing this to an Age of Sail adventure, if a celestial body is an island, than wildspace is the sea.  Just as the sea is comprised of a large amount of water, wildspace is comprised of a large amount of aether.  Now keep in mind that wildspace is the sea, not yet the ocean. When we look at the wildspace around the Forgotten Realms setting, it's like we're looking at an archipelago of islands.",

														"The first challenge you face in leaving your planet is gravity. Imagine that gravity is like a powerful rip tide, always pulling you back in when you try to leave. That said, gravity behaves differently in Wildjammer than you might expect. Unlike real-life, gravity is either on or off, and it always pulls like earth-normal gravity, unless magic gets involved to amplify or hamper it. In other words, gravity doesn't get stronger or weaker based on its source, it just extends out farther from the source. Any object with a dimension of 25 feet or more has a gravity field.",
														"You might wonder why this never comes up in your favorite D&D setting. The answer is that when two sources of peavey) are in close contact, the larger field trumps the smaller. Since everything on a planet is smaller than the planet, the planet's gravity is the only one in effect (unless some form of magic is used). Only in wildspace can two gravity fields overlap without one disabling the other, and even then only if the sources don't touch.  ",
														"Another interesting feature about gravity is that it always pulls in the direction most convenient to the source. This usually results in a single gravity source that pulls all things toward it. For example, a planet pulls down to the core, while a wildjammer's gravity pulls down to the main deck of the snip Similarly, a dragon could lay down on its gravity plane and swim through space. They just can't get close to the planet.",
														"This leads to some interesting physics. First, imagine a classic Age of Sail ship. There's the main deck, masts, sails, and all of that. The gravity field runs along the main deck, pulling you down onto it while you're standing on it. If you go beneath the main deck, you end up swinging past the gravity plane so you're standing on the underside of the main deck! You're upside down from those on the main deck. Luckily, most ships that go into space are designed to make the gravity field pull to the lowest deck, so this doesn't always come up."

														"Now that you understand gravity, what about air? How are you supposed to breath outside of the air of your planet? In Wildjammer, all creatures and objects can carry a certain amount of air out into wildspace with them based on their size. The size of this air bubble is always the same as the size of the gravity field, if the creature or object has one. All things can carry air into empty space, but only larger things have gravity.",
														"What this means is that as soon as you find a way off of your planet's gravity field, you're also going to leave its air envelope and take only as much air as your size allows. This means you'll want something large like a wildjammer. These ships are large enough that they carry a substantial air bubble with them wherever they go. Similarly, massive creatures like dragons that fly through space carry their own air bubble that can sometimes be enough to sustain them for long trips.",
														"Be wary however, you can end up running out of air!  All wildjammers can carry an amount of air based on their size. The more creatures aboard that breath the air, the less time it takes to expend it all. Once the air is expended, it becomes fouled, giving all creatures breathing it disadvantage on all checks. The fouled air lasts just as long as the fresh air did. If this fouled air is expended, the air becomes lethal and all creatures aboard gain a point of exhaustion every minute they breath the lethal air.",
														"Luckily, getting new air isn't too difficult! Whenever two air envelopes come into contact, the air distributes evenly between the two envelopes. For example, if two equal sized air envelopes overlapped, and one of them is lethal and the other is completely fresh, they would both split the difference and become foul. This isn't the best way to get new air.",
														"The best and most common way to get new air is to sail your wildjammer close enough to a planet's atmosphere that the ship's air envelope overlaps with the planet's air envelope. Since the planet has so much more air than the ship, the ship's air bubble is fully replenished. It is also possible to restore some air to an air envelope by finding pockets of air around asteroids. The air in asteroid fields is generally far less abundant than in the atmosphere of a planet.",

														"Now we know that to escape from our planet, we need to find a way to get past our planet's gravity and a way to carry a lot of air with us. A wildjammer will carry the air for us, so we just need a way to escape from our planet's gravity field. Luckily, having a wildjammer allows the person flying it to see aether currents, rivers of luminescent blue energy that descend down from wildspace onto the planet.",
														"If a planet is an island, wildspace is the sea, and the aether is the water that comprises the sea, then these aether currents are like large rivers, bays, and inlets.  These make navigating from an island to the sea significantly easier. Just as different groups during the Age of Sail looked to control port cities, bays, and river ways, so too do factions in wildspace seek to control these points of entry into and out of planets.",
														"To extend the comparison even further, just like natural rivers, bays, and inlets, catastrophes can occur that cause these to dry up and no longer provide access to wildjammers looking to ascend from or descend to the planet. These schisms can be caused by magical catastrophe or just through natural processes that aren't well understood. No matter what, those who are interested in controlling these shipping lanes into planets might find themselves scrambling to maintain control after such a shift! Even worse, all the aether currents could dry up, isolating the planet from the wildjammers of wildspace."

												"Alright! We've now escaped from our planet (island) and we've sailed along the aether (water) all around wildspace (the sea). In that time, you meet other creatures, encounter dangers in space, and all sorts of fun stuff. Eventually your eye might turn to one of the stars. What is there beyond this sea? What lies beyond wildspace? Where is the ocean in this comparison I've been making? You decide to find out. You turn your wildjammer to a star you see and you set sail away from the only planets (islands) that you have known.  Now things start to get weird! You've set sail, you've got a crew with you all eager to see what lies at that star you picked out. You have that same anxious optimism that Truman Burbank felt as he sailed out across the sea that had trapped in The Truman Show (1998). Just like Truman, you're in for a big surprise when the bowsprit of your wildjammer crashes into a wall.",
												"You walk to the fore of your ship and reach out. Your hand settles on a wall. That blackness you saw so long ago when you were standing on your planet is a wall, a shell surrounding wildspace on every side. What you're touching is called a crystal sphere.",
												"Crystal spheres are supermassive constructs so large they can contain an entire solar system (or more) within them. The idea of crystal spheres is based on the theory of the celestial spheres presented to us by Plato, Aristotle, Ptolemy, Eudoxus, and Copernicus.  The theory held that our solar system is surrounded by a shell with the stars affixed to the inside of it.",
												"In Wildjammer, these crystal spheres are real. These spheres mark the boundary of a campaign setting.  When you pass through a crystal sphere, you are officially leaving that setting and its rules behind.",
												"Even the gods are limited to the inside of the crystal Spheres: This makes it so that no matter how powerful the gods, how wild the lore, how unique the lore is, it doesn't influence any other setting out there. Want a low magic setting? Maybe a sci-fi setting? Maybe one where people are slowly driven insane due to an eldritch horror living in the sun? Maybe you want a sphere that just has a bunch of space turtles with worlds on their backs. All of this is possible just by wrapping it in a sphere.",
												"Luckily passing through a crystal sphere isn't too hard. Natural portals appear and disappear seemingly at random along the crystal sphere. These portals can be located with lower level divination spells for the starting wildjammer crew, or they can be created with advanced wildjammer equipment or high level spells.",
												"In the ongoing comparison, think of the sphere as that point when you pass from the sea into the ocean itself. Behind you is an archipelago of islands, and ahead of you is the open ocean."

												"Now lets continue on in our adventure. We repair the damage done to the hull by crashing into the wall of the crystal sphere unexpectedly and then we find a way to one of the portals on its surface. In much the same way that a sailing ship departs from an archipelago to set sail across the vast ocean, as you pass the threshold of the crystal sphere, you'll find yourself in the vast rainbow ocean known as the phlogiston.",
												"The phlogiston, sometimes called the flow or the rainbow ocean, is a vast expanse of rainbow colors that fill in the space between crystal spheres. It is hard to describe the actual substance of the phlogiston, as it does flow into a ship's air bubble without replacing the air itself. It doesn't block sight except for things at a distance, much like a fog. It is like being in a rainbow colored expressionist painting.",
												"Take a moment to imagine a fish tank. In this fish tank, we have an infinite amount of space and it is full of this rainbow substance. Floating around inside are these large glass balls, inside which is wildspace, celestial bodies, and all the civilizations we know from our D&D adventures. This is the material plane. See?  I told you things get wild in space!",
												"That said, the phlogiston has some odd properties.  The first and more important one is that it is highly flammable and acts like an accelerant. If you are brave or foolish enough to light a flame, you will invariably find the flame exploding the second it is ignited, likely harming you and your ship in the process. There have been many attempts over the years to attempt to weaponize the phlogiston, but regrettably it dissipates shortly after brought brought past the threshold of a crystal sphere. No one is sure why this happens, but it is probably for the best. If the phlogiston were ever to flow into a crystal sphere, it would find its way to the fire planets and sun, causing it to ignite the phlogiston and blow up the entire sphere!",
												"Perhaps even more oddly, the phlogiston seems to ground dimensional or planar magic. All attempts to reach out to the inner or outer planes from the flow fail completely. This is because there are no planes while you're in the phlogiston!",
												"The best way to think about the phlogiston is as an insulation between settings. No matter how powerful a god might be in Forgotten Realms, that god has no power in Ravnica until the DM decides they have powers and can act as a god in that setting. No matter what the writers for Greyhawk do with the planes, it doesn't contaminate what Eberron does with their planes. The phlogiston insulates against setting contamination, giving the DM the freedom to use whatever cosmos they like, or mix it up per setting.",
												"With regards to the Age of Sail comparison, the phlogiston is like the open ocean. It is a vast, empty space that exists between archipelagos and continents.  Most of the time, all you'll see is the horizon until you reach new land, such as finding a new crystal sphere.  Just as sailors found routes across the ocean based on wind and water currents, so too are there flow currents in the phlogiston that help sailors navigate the flow.",
												"While combat can happen in the phlogiston, it isn't common. The open ocean is vast and the chance of running into another ship is slim when compared to the chance of running into another ship in a more densely packed archipelago. Even if you do encounter another ship, it is rare that they want to engage in combat due to the limits on gunpowder. Still, there are sailors that tell tall tales about great flow fiends that harvest unwary sailors who fall overboard. It's enough for most to remain vigilant out on the rainbow ocean."

												"Now that we've discussed how you can take your ship across the material plane, from your home planet to a completely different campaign setting, what about the planes? Most D&D settings have some concept of the planes above, whether it be the Great Wheel from Planescape, the World Tree from Forgotten Realms, or even the Cosmology of Eberron. The different models can sometimes include similar or identical planes, or they could have completely new ones. This poses an interesting challenge to Wildjammer where our adventurers may travel from one setting to another, but not an insuperable one.",
												"All of the planes reside within a massive ocean-like space called the Astral Sea, and a properly equipped wildjammer can get there and sail between the planes themselves, just as it would between worlds. This is made possible through an expensive upgrade to a wildjammer that etches powerful arcane runes to the hull which allow a spellcaster who casts {@i plane shift} to warp their ship and all of its passengers into the Astral Sea near the plane they want to reach. From there they can simply sail through the threshold of the plane to appear in it.",
												"All that said, sailing the Astral Sea can be dangerous.  Massive monstrosities like the Astral Dreadnought swim around searching for prey. The dominions of the gods send out fleets to battle against one another, or protect the borders of their plane from attack. The Blood War itself reaches into the Astral Sea, with the Helljammers of Baator working regularly to restrain the expansion of the Scourge Fleet of the Abyss. Traveling through the Astral Sea is not something to take lightly!",

														"In Wildjammer, the planes can best be understood through the Infinite Planes model. Any plane the DM can imagine exists somewhere in the Astral Sea. These planes are completely independent of one another and the material plane until they are bound by thought, belief, and the faith of people in a crystal sphere. This means that the population of each sphere creates a metaphysical link between their sphere and a subset of the infinite planes. This in turn shapes how scholars of that sphere see the planar cosmos.",
														"For example, lets say a crew from Faerun which has a connection to the Great Wheel were to travel to Ravnica where there isn't a Mount Celestia. Although those people know about Mount Celestia, a plane shift spell couldn't bring them there because Mount Celestia isn't connected to that sphere. On the other hand, some planes do have connections in multiple spheres, like Mount Celestia being recognized in both the Greyhawk and Forgotten Realms campaign settings.  You could plane shift from either crystal sphere to the same Mount Celestia and back to either.",
														"This allows a crystal sphere to be as independent from or engaged with other settings, even at the planar level. Hopefully you see how all of this, the phlogiston, the spheres, the Astral Sea comes together into a model of the multiverse that is highly adaptable and flexible to any campaign a DM wants to run!",

When a spellcaster sits on these thrones, they can attune to the helm, allowing their magic to seep into it and then throughout the ship itself. This causes the Helmsman's senses to extend across the ship and allow them to move it as if they were moving their own bodies. Through this bond, a Helmsman is able to propel their ship at incredible speeds that allow them to sail across the vast distances of wildspace and the Flow.",
												"The type of helm I just described is known as a Wildjammer Helm. It is the most common type of helm found around the spheres thanks to the effort of their main purveyors, the Arcane. Nevertheless, there are other helms out there. Mind flayers use a Pool Helm, a type of brine pool filled with illithid slugs that craw upon the psionic energy of the Helmsman.  There's the Orbus, a weakened and enslaved beholder that is used by other beholders to propel their Tyrant Ships. Dwarves favor a helm called the Forge Helm, which when installed into the core of a mountain can create propulsion from the energy of their creations, resulting in flying mountains. The neogi favor a type of helm called a Lifejammer Helm, an iron maiden like device that drains the blood and essence out of slaves and converts it into propulsion.",

The stories always end with a gruesome death at the hands of Arcane enforcers, They seem to have some type of ability to track Wildjammer Helms and know if someone is the licensed owner. Thanks to this combination of seemingly omnipotent knowledge of every helm and the severity of their enforcement, no black market has ever emerged.",

In this state, they are unable to defend themselves from attack unless they first break attunement with the helm. Similarly, they are unable to get up from the helm until they break attunement with it by taking another half-hour. Due to this vulnerability while attuned to the helm, most wildjammers are designed with the helm in a highly defensible room.",

A wildjammer can't accelerate to jamming speed while in the gravity field of another mega scale object or mega creature.",
																"When moving at jamming speed, the wildjammer always moves in a straight line and always at a speed of just over 4 million miles per hour. This means in a standard 12 hour traveling day for a Helmsman, the wildjammer can travel 50 million miles That's a little over half the distance from earth to the Sun. With two on alternating shifts, the ship travels 100 million miles per day, a bit over the distance from earth to the Sun.",

Should a wildjammer be traveling and get close to a mega creature, wildjammer, celestial body, or some other large object on mega scale, the wildjammer immediately slows to tactical speed. This sudden loss of speed isn't a detriment to anyone aboard, but it does mean the wildjammer has to maneuver around the obstacle and spend another minute charging the helm to accelerate back to jamming speeds."

When hover sailing, a wildjammer can sail or fly a maximum number of miles per hour equal to five times the Helmsman's highest unexpended spell slot.

																"The mechanics of wildjammer combat I've discussed so far are all fairly simple. In the combat section, I talked about how mega scale encounters attempt to mimic ground scale combat as closely as possible.  Sadly, there is one mechanic that needs to be added that has no ground scale equivalent: maneuverability.",
																"Generally speaking, maneuverability is the degree to which the wildjammer can turn while in motion. In ground scale combat, we're used to being able to move in any direction up to our speed. While controlling a ship in a mega scale encounter, we are limited in how much we can turn.",
																"Picture a ship sailing on the sea. If they wanted to turn around, could they pivot on the spot? Not really.  They could try doing some fancy maneuvers, but turning a large ship generally takes a bit of time and an arc in the path they sail.",
																"To deal with this mechanically, every wildjammer has a maneuverability score. This score can be 360°, 180°, 135°, 90°, 45°, and 0°. When a wildjammer moves, they can move up to their speed within a cone of movement equal to that maneuverability score.  After they move, they can then turn up to that many degrees left or right from the direction they are facing.",
																"For grid play, wildjammers can face up to 8 directions, corresponding with the four cardinal directions and four intercardinal directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, & NW. Each of these is 45°. For example, if your ship's speed is 3,000 ft. (90°) and it is facing north, it can move 3,000 feet in a 90° cone, and then can turn up to 90° left or right, from north to east or from north to west.",
																"For those of you who play gridless or use hexes, use whatever works at your table! Just adjust these rules to take account of it. Hex play will probably be the toughest as this system is designed around grid or gridless to match up with normal fifth edition combat.",
																"It's also worth noting that while a wildjammer is sailing at wildjammer speed, the crew do not need to actively work the sails because a wildjammer can't turn while at that speed. Crew still need to be standing by at the ready in case they get pulled out of jamming speed by something!",

You're unlikely to find automated production lines crafting hulls, ship mounted weapons, or modules in one of the many jamming port cities.  The vast majority of wildjammers were, at some point or another, crafted by a person or group of people who have their own personal preferences, goals for the wildjammer, and/or artistic vision. Like the creations of shipwrights during the Age of Sail, each wildjammer carries the unique signature of the person or people who originally crafted it.",

Think of this as a picture that we show two different artists and ask them to reproduce. Each of those artists will bring their own unique flavor and style to it, resulting in two variations of the same original picture.",

That wildjammer might end up being created out of metal instead of wood, resulting in more AC but slower movement speed.

												"In this section, we'll be going over how wildjammers protect themselves against the other ships and the gargantuan mega creatures that live in wildspace. The ship combat system presented here is an adaptation of the ship combat system Mage Hand Press designed for their Dark Matter campaign setting. This system is not compatible with the ship combat system presented in the official D&D 5e books. The goal of this system is to make the ship feel more like a tool the party uses and gets better at as they level up, similar to getting better with a weapon or at casting spells.",

Many DMs are completely fine with using the party's ship as a narrative tool for conveying the party around to different locations, to act as a central base, and even as a recurring battlemap with monsters attacking the party on the ship itself.

												"As you've read through this supplement, you've likely seen the word mega come up a lot. In Wildjammer, you can run combat in either ground scale or mega scale. Ground scale is the scale that you're likely already familiar with from playing D&D 5e. Mega scale is the scale in which ship combat takes place. If this book refers to something as mega, it means that something is only applicable to ship scale combat. For example, ships have mega hit points, also called hull points, and they deal mega damage. The purpose of this is to keep a clear line between which mechanics apply to which kind of combat. A bunch of undead landing on your ship and attacking the crew is a ground scale fight, while battling a massive space kraken or a rogue moon is a mega scale fight.",
												"As a general rule of thumb, something mega is 100 times what it normally would be. For example, ground scale has a 5-foot by 5-foot grid, while at mega scale, ship combat has a 500-foot by 500-foot grid. If you deal 1 damage to a creature, they lose 1 hit point, but if you deal 1 mega damage to a creature, they lose 100 hit points, which is equivalent to 1 mega hit point.",
												"As you might imagine, this means you could easily mop up Tiamat with her ~600 hit points by dealing just 6 mega hit points. For this reason, it is important to understand that this difference of scale is a convention for the division of mechanics, not for translating them between scales. Just as a wizard shouldn't be casting a ground scale fireball at an enemy ship, an enemy ship shouldn't be attacking a ground scale wizard. There are ways for the wizard to cast their spells in a mega scale fight, and if the enemy ship wants to attack the wizard, they can get in close and board the wizard's ship and handle it in ground combat.",
												"One thing that doesn't scale up between these scales is time. A single round of combat is 6 seconds in both. The purpose of this is to make it easier on the DM should player characters be in ground combat while others are on the ship fighting against something else.",

While it may seem intuitive that the cannons on a ship would be dexterity based ranged weapons, this leaves many martial characters at a disadvantage that doesn't feel particularly fun. For this reason, this system has a new kind of attack, a {@i Ship Weapon Attack}.",
														"When a character makes a ship weapon attack, they roll a d20 and add their proficiency plus either their Strength or Dexterity modifier (their choice) to the attack roll. Based on circumstances, the DM may call for this roll to be made at advantage or disadvantage. If the total of this attack meets or beats the AC of the target, the attack hits. On a hit, the character rolls the damage of the ship weapon, but they do not add their modifier to the damage roll.",
														"Some classes have features that modify their attacks. Both the Gunner and Fighter Helmsman role have a feature to allow these to work in ship combat subject to DM approval. Using a feature like {@classFeature Extra Attack|Fighter||5} with a ship weapon is fairly self-explanatory, but a feature like a barbarian's Reckless Attack doesn't translate well to mega scale. It either has no drawback or it has a drawback that hampers the entire group (beyond what it normally would). Luckily, a barbarian could jump into a Spirit Warrior where Reckless Attack makes more sense.",
														"DMs, remember that players build their characters because they like to use the abilities of the character. Reckless Attack is problematic because the drawback effects the entire party. Something like Divine Smite has no such drawback. I encourage you to be open and adaptable to using class features at mega scale!"

A ship which is at 50% or fewer hull points has disadvantage on grapple checks. A ship at 25% or fewer hull points will usually have a mutiny to force the bridge crew to surrender.",

In Wildjammer, the answer is rather simple: No matter how strong a god is in one sphere, that power doesn't translate to another sphere. No matter how hegemonic their power may be in their sphere, the sphere itself is a hard limit. Ifa god wishes to have power in another sphere, they need expand their religion and get followers in that sphere.",

																"Now lets put this party in a Dragonfly. This ship has 75 HP, 12 AC, and 1 light catapult. When one of the Gunners uses the light catapult, they have a +10 to hit and they deal 7 (3d4) mega bludgeoning damage per attack, plus 5 once per turn from the Gunner feature {@optfeature Precise Shot|wjmais}. Assuming our Gunner is a Fighter with {@classFeature Extra Attack|Fighter||5} (2), that means this ship can deal an average of 26 (7 + 7 + 7 + 5) mega damage each turn if every attack hits. That's pretty good when going against a Dragonfly or other low tier ship!",
																"Lets put the same party in something bigger, a Hammership. Their ship has 250 HP, 16 AC, and 3 heavy catapults. The Gunners still have a +10 to hit, but now they deal 13 (3d8) mega bludgeoning damage per attack, plus 5 from the {@optfeature Precise Shot|wjmais} Gunner feature. Furthermore, all 3 Gunners can make attacks, as the ship has more hardpoints. Lets say all Gunners are Fighters with {@classFeature Extra Attack|Fighter||5} (2), that means they can do 44 a +13+13+5) each. That's a total of 132 damage if all attacks hit!",
																"See how different this is? The same party in separate ships is a big change. The point I want to convey here is that when you are balancing your encounters, you need to design the offensive potential of your enemies based on the defensive potential of your party's ship. Your party will get better, but a ship is like a piece of equipment. It doesn't level up with you, it doesn't get better just because the characters aboard it are better. The characters can use weapons better (higher attack bonuses and the like), but the ship isn't changing."

Build your enemy ships in exactly the same way. Don't get bogged down on the exact stats of every bridge crew officer (except for use in a boarding fight). I never reference the creatures aboard the ship when running an enemy ship, I just build the ship's stat block to include whatever features I want it to have.",

										"This supplement was put together for free and I have not made or seek to make money off of it, nor should anyone else. I'm just a fan of this setting and want to offer a way to play it in 5e! I don't own Dungeons & Dragons and I don't own the rights to Wildjammer. Much of what is in this supplement comes from information that can be googled or original ideas by myself or others. In this section, I'll be attempting to give thanks to everyone that helped along the way.",
										"First off, big thanks to Jeff Grubb and the other writers and designers on the Wildjammer team back at TSR who helped bring this setting to life. Although Wizards of the Coast hasn't published much of Wildjammer since the original run, the fact that it holds an esteemed position in the community speaks volumes to how creative and great a setting it is.",
										"Second, huge thanks for the Mage Hand Press team. After spending months trying to find a way to make ship combat feel fun, it was your combat system in Dark Matter that inspired me the most to get this project going and carry on with it so long. I'm looking forward to getting my backer kit, and I recommend everyone else who reads this far to go check out their stuff, {@link here|https://store.magehandpress.com/}.",

The goal in creating the Threshership was to build an affordable and formidable combat ship for new privateers, who so often found themselves retrofitting commercial ships for combat purposes.",

The head itself acts as a ram, intending to charge up to enemy wildjammers or mega creatures and hit them in close range. This has lead to many using the Threshership as a Fire Projector platform, moving in close, hitting hard, and covering ships in waves of fire.",
											"What adds to the versatility of the Threshership beyond just a combat wildjammer is that the wildjammer's fins act as landing gear for ground landings.

The Griffon's Rest blade is a symbol of hope and protection against even the most insurmountable odds."

Be sure of the players' intended actions before a trap activates so that it springs into action based on what the players want to do, rather than a course of action they're arguing about or merely considering. If the players discover a trap, be open to adjudicating their ideas for defeating it. The trap's description is a starting point for countermeasures, rather than a complete definition.",

Ask the players where their characters are positioned and what they intend to do to defeat the trap. A player can't just say, \"I use thieves' tools to disable it.\" That's too murky. The player instead should describe something like, \"I use my thieves' tools to examine the lock and attempt to disable the poison needle inside it.\" The last thing you want is confusion over where the characters are located if a trap activates.",

Complex traps work best when they present multiple threats to intruders, ones that can change each round. The changes can include how a trap targets the characters (attack or even type of saving throw), the damage or effects it deals, the areas it covers, and so on. Some traps might have a random effect each round, while others follow a carefully programmed sequence of attacks designed to frustrate and slay intruders.",

Disabling a rune that triggers a firebreathing statue might cause the statue to explode, as the magic in it runs rampant.

														"Not all of the characters' options must be focused on stopping a trap. Think of what characters can do to mitigate or avoid a trap's effects. This approach is a good way to make characters who might be ill -suited to disarm a trap feel useful. An Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check might reveal the pattern a swinging blade follows, giving disadvantage on its attack rolls until the start of the character's next turn. A character with a shield can stand in front of a dart trap, making themself a target each time other characters trigger it."

										"The D&D combat rules in the Player's Handbook are designed to model conflict between small groups—an adventuring party of perhaps three to six characters against monster groups that rarely exceed a dozen creatures. Combat on this scale keeps the focus squarely on the adventurers.",
										"In some D&D campaigns, though, the story might hinge on battles involving dozens or hundreds of monsters and warriors. The rules presented here build on the standard combat rules to model conflict on a much larger scale, while still enabling individual adventurers to lead an army's charge against an enemy regiment, rally dispirited soldiers to rejoin the fray, or defeat powerful enemy monsters or leaders.",
										"In most cases, when two armies oppose one another, the DM serves as the general for one side, and one or more players serve as generals for the opposing force.

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.\n\n**Celestial Revelation. **When you reach 3rd level, choose one of the revelation options below. Thereafter, you can use a bonus action to unleash the celestial energy within yourself, gaining the benefits of that revelation. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action.
